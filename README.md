Interactive Image Gallery

This project demonstrates a simple image gallery with filtering, hover effects, and a lightbox.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For structuring the page and content.
CSS: For styling the layout, grid, hover effects, and responsiveness.
JavaScript: For handling filtering, hover effects, lightbox, and potentially "Load More" functionality.
Features:

Grid-based Gallery: Images are displayed in a responsive grid layout.
Filtering: Filter buttons allow users to quickly view images by category (e.g., "All," "Nature," "Cats", "Horses" and "Food").
Hover Effects: On hover, each image displays a caption overlay.
Lightbox: Clicking an image opens a lightbox for a larger view with navigation buttons.

Load More: A "Load More" button loads additional images without reloading the page.
